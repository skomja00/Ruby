**Dynamic Programming**  
Usually, solving and fully understanding a dynamic programming problem is a 4 step process:  

1. Start with the recursive backtracking solution  
2. Optimize by using a memoization table (top-down[2] dynamic programming)  
3. Remove the need for recursion (bottom-up dynamic programming)  
4. Apply final tricks to reduce the time / memory complexity
